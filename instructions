cat /sys/fs/cgroup/psicgroup1/cgroup.procs
    In Linux cgroups, when a process that has been added to a cgroup terminates,
    it is automatically removed from the cgroup's cgroup.procs file. This means that once
    your child processes complete their execution (after the 30-second sleep in your code), they exit,
    and the cgroup becomes empty. Therefore, checking cgroup.procs after
    the processes have finished will show no active PIDs.
